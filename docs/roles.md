### RR Types
?> Types are per message and change their behavior. Every message has a type which defaults to normal.

<!-- tabs:start -->

<!-- tab:Prefix Commands -->
| Name              | Example           | Usage                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **rr unique \<msg_id>** | `!rr unique 123456` | Marks a message as 'unique' meaning a member can only claim one role from this message at a time, this works per message. Automatically removes the old reactions for you. |
| **rr binding \<msg_id>** | `!rr binding 123456` | A combination of rr verify and rr unique. Allowing for members to limit people to one choice ever. |
| **rr verify \<msg_id>** | `!rr verify 123456` | With this enabled, reactions can only assign roles, not take them away. Additionally the bot automatically removes the reaction after the user reacts. This is useful for servers that want a verification reaction |
| **rr drop \<msg_id>** | `!rr drop 123456` | Works sort of like `verify`, except it can only remove roles (and roles are removed when the emoji is added). |
| **rr normal \<msg_id>** | `!rr normal 123456` | This returns the reaction role message back to a normal reaction role message. Meaning any commands applied to it such as verify or unique will be removed. |
| **rr reversed \<msg_id>** | `!rr reversed 123456` | Reacting removes roles, unreacting adds roles.                    |
| **rr lock \<msg_id>** | `!rr lock 123456` | Locks the message preventing any roles from being handed out.             |
| **rr temp \<msg_id> \<time>** | `!rr temp 123456 24h` | This is a [Premium](https://www.patreon.com/carlbot) command. This allows for roles to be temporarily be assigned to a member and then removed after the designated amount of time. |
| **rr link \<base_id> \<target_id>** | `!rr link 123456 456789` | By linking two or more messages together, only one role from either message can be self-assigned. |
| **rr unlink \<msg_id>** | `!rr unlink 123456` | This breaks apart the entire group created by `rr link`.              |
| **rr limit \<msg_id> \<limit>** | `!rr limit 123456 5` | Limits members to picking up x amount of roles from a message. |

<!-- tab:Slash Commands -->
| Name              | Example           | Usage                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **reactionrole modify \<choice> \<message_id>** | `/reactionrole modify unique 123456` | Choose between the different types of reaction roles to apply to the message, all in just a single command. |
| **reactionrole normal \<message_id>** | `/reactionrole normal 123456` | This returns the reaction role message back to a normal reaction role message. Meaning any commands applied to it such as verify or unique will be removed. |
| **reactionrole temp \<message_id> \<duration>** | `/reactionrole temp 123456 24h` | This is a [Premium](https://www.patreon.com/carlbot) command. This allows for roles to be temporarily be assigned to a member and then removed after the designated amount of time. |
| **reactionrole links** | `/reactionrole links` | Shows the currently linked messages.                                 |
| **reactionrole link \<message_ids>** | `/reactionrole link 123456 456789` | By linking two or more messages together, only one role from either message can be self-assigned. |
| **reactionrole unlink \<message_id>** | `/reactionrole unlink 123456` | This breaks apart the entire group created by `reactionrole link`. |
| **reactionrole limit \<message_id> \<limit>** | `/reactionrole limit 123456 5` | Limits members to picking up the specified amount of roles from a message. |

| **rr aiov \<channel> \<color> \<title\|description> \<emoji> \<role>** | | All in one command to create a verification reaction role. |
| **rr aioi \<channel> \<color> \<title\|description> \<emoji> \<role>** | | All in one command to create an inverse verification reaction role, i.e. one that only removes roles. |
| **rr fixforeign \<msg_id>** | `!rr fixforeign 123456` | Makes the bot react to emojis the bot doesn't have access to. This command isn't required for these emojis to work, it only makes it so that the bot has its reactions added to the message. You have to react to the message with Emojis you want before using this command. |
| **rr maxroles \<msg_id> [<role> \<number>...]** | `!rr maxroles 123456 DPS 10` | Limit the number of each role in a reaction role. This actually checks for how many people have the role, not how many reactions there are. |

| **reactionrole fixforeign \<message_id> [channel]** | `/reactionrole fixforeign 123456` | Makes the bot react to emojis the bot doesn't have access to. This command isn't required for these emojis to work, it only makes it so that the bot has its reactions added to the message. You have to react to the message with Emojis you want before using this command. |
| **reactionrole maxroles \<message_id> [roles_and_limits]** | `/reactionrole maxroles 123456 DPS 10` | Limit the number of each role in a reaction role. This actually checks for how many people have the role, not how many reactions there are. |

## Role Management
?> These commands are for administrators to manage role assignments in their servers. The bot might mention that you require additional permissions despite having <span style="color: red;">Manage Roles</span>. To fix this, make sure both you and the bot have roles higher in the role heirarchy than the role you are trying to assign.
